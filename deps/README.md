# Deps (Additional Dependencies)

This directory contains all the additional REQUIRED dependencies that JPEGView needs to compile.

## WTL

Homepage: [SourceForge Windows Template Library (WTL)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/)

FYI: WTL cannot be included in the JPEGView source distribution, because **Microsoft Public License** is INCOMPATIBLE with **GPL**.

You can, however clone the submodule into this directory.

To build JPEGView and have it automatically find WTL, clone the submodule.  (Alternatively, you can download a zip file from the WTL project page and extract it to a folder named *wtl-sf*)
